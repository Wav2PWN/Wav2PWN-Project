# Wav2PWN Project Overview
Wav2PWN leverages the transferability of adversarial examples across self-supervised ASR models to infer the architecture of a target black-box model and launch targeted attacks. We first construct a behavioral response matrix that captures the attack success rates and transferability characteristics among multiple white-box SSL models (e.g., Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, Conformer). By comparing how a set of adversarial examples behave on the unknown black-box system against this reference matrix, we infer the most likely architecture of the target model. Once the closest white-box proxy model is identified, Wav2PWN generates targeted adversarial audio samples using it, achieving highly effective black-box attacks with minimal query requirements.

# How to Run
## Download LibriSpeech Dataset
To run this project, you will need a set of clean original audio samples. We recommend using the LibriSpeech test-clean subset.

ðŸ”— Download Link
Official site: http://www.openslr.org/12

Recommended subset: test-clean.tar.gz

After this step, your directory structure should look like:

```
Wav2PWN-Project/
â”œâ”€â”€ LibriSpeech/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ test-clean/
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ ...
```

## ðŸ“¥ Download Results

You can access our generated adversarial examples and transcription logs for eight test models from the link below:
